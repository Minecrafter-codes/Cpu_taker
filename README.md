This requires Python and Pygame 

Running this file will take up lot of cpu but your os will lag depending on your device



download and execute this program at your friends computer and see what is thier reactions

How it works:

    1. It uses threading to do the trick
    2. that thread plays a sound using pygame mxer
    3. when a thread finished playing a sound or still playing a sound it will trigger another thread. causing to multiply
    4. Before threads run a while loop triggers thread cause to create lot of thread and so on
    5. when executing for long time your os is sill running fine but this will lag a lot and sometimes it freezes it depending on your device

Is this crash your os:

    Depending on your device.

    if your device is low end. There is a chance you device will restart because your os crashed

    if your device is high end. Then it will not crash your os
